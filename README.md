# AwsS3Ng
Will show how to consume and disaply data from api endpoints created in aws.
The first will be a mock service from outside aws - it will display bitcoin exchange rate.
The second one will be with elastic beanstalk using python.
The third one will be through api gateway.

This demo is based on two web resources:
https://angular.io/guide/http
https://www.techiediaries.com/angular-by-example-httpclient-get/

good luck!
